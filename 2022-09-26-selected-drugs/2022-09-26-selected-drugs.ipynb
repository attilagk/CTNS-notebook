    "    * [GPR84](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GPR84): G-Protein Coupled Receptor 84.  Receptor for medium-chain free fatty acid (FFA) with carbon chain lengths of C9 to C14. Capric acid (C10:0), undecanoic acid (C11:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) are the most potent agonists. Not activated by short-chain and long-chain saturated and unsaturated FFAs. Activation by medium-chain free fatty acid is coupled to a pertussis toxin sensitive G(i/o) protein pathway. May have important roles in processes from fatty acid metabolism to regulation of the immune system.\n",
